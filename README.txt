## Problem Statement

US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not. The company wants to know:

**GOAL**

    - Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
    - How well those variables describe the price of a house.

Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.
